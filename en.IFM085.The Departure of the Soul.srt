1
00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:11,377
It depends on the karma, what they
have done here on Earth, you see.
它取决于业力 取决于他们在地球上做了什么

2
00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:18,511
Some souls which are very attached
to their material things, they roam around
一些灵魂非常依附于他们的物质享受 他们四处闲逛

3
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,866
until they can realise that
that is not - they are not free.
直到他们可以认识到那不是 他们不是自由的

4
00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,955
Like that many souls
have helped a lot.
很多灵魂就像那样 （我）帮助过许多这样的灵魂

5
00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,400
And the Atma in itself,
与他们内在的阿特玛

6
00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,044
when somebody dies

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,044
it goes in different lokas because
it's like a journey. You go,
他去向不同的洛卡 因为它就像一个旅程 你去

8
00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:52,577
you learn something and come back.
Or if you have heavy karma, like I said,
你学到一些东西并回来 或者如果你有很重的业力 就像我说的

9
00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:56,044
that time there and
time here is different.
那里的时间和这里的时间是不同的

10
00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,088
So, you will go where you have to,
 according to your karma.
所以 根据你的业力 你将去到你必须去的地方 

11
00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:13,222
So, it's not - you see, very often
people say, I have heard people say,
所以 它不是 你瞧 通常人们说 我听过人们说

12
00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:17,022
"You know, this
priest has told me
这个神父已经告诉我

13
00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:25,355
that after I die if I have been doing so much
japa, prayer, all these stuff, I will be free."
如果我加帕（念诵圣名）很多 经常祈祷 所有的这些 那么我死后 我将会自由

14
00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,511
And then you live your life
like a savage, you know,
接着你依旧像野人一样生活

15
00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:34,155
and thinking that yes, you will be free because
that priest has told you yes, you will do so much
并认为着是的 你将会自由因为神父已经告诉过你  你要念诵很多

16
00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,333
japa, then you do everything mechanically,
everything, then you say, yes, you will be free.
加帕 接着你机械地做着每一件事 然后你说 会的 你将会自由

17
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,555
You will never be free!
你永远也不会自由

18
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,822
Because freedom is
not attained just like that.
因为自由不是像那样去获得的

19
00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:55,622
That's why I said, you know,
the mind has to surrender.
那就是为什么我说 头脑必须臣服

20
00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:01,466
Otherwise, if that mind is not
surrendered, you can't attain Him.
否则 如果头脑不臣服 你无法臻达祂
