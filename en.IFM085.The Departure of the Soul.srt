00:00:07,222 --> 00:00:11,377

It depends on the karma, what they

have done here on Earth, you see.

它取决于业力 取决于你在地球上做了什么



2

00:00:12,577 --> 00:00:18,511

Some souls which are very attached

to their material things, they roam around

一些灵魂非常依附于他们的物质享受 他们四处闲逛



3

00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:24,866

until they can realise that

that is not - they are not free.

直到他们可以认识到那不是 他们不是自由的



4

00:00:27,311 --> 00:00:30,955

Like that many souls

have helped a lot.





5

00:00:32,155 --> 00:00:35,400

And the Atma in itself,





6

00:00:36,733 --> 00:00:39,044

when somebody dies

当某人死去时



7

00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:46,044

it goes in different lokas because

it's like a journey. You go,

他去向不同的界 因为它就像一个旅程 你去



8

00:00:47,111 --> 00:00:52,577

you learn something and come back.

Or if you have heavy karma, like I said,

你学到一些东西并回来 或者如果你有很重的业力 就像我说的



9

00:00:53,644 --> 00:00:56,044

that time there and

time here is different.

那里的时间和这里的时间是不同的



10

00:00:57,066 --> 00:01:00,088

So, you will go where you have to,

 according to your karma.

所以 你将去到你必须去的地方 根据你的业力



11

00:01:08,711 --> 00:01:13,222

So, it's not - you see, very often

people say, I have heard people say,

所以 它不是 你瞧 通常人们说 我听过人们说



12

00:01:14,644 --> 00:01:17,022

"You know, this

priest has told me

这个神父已经告诉我



13

00:01:17,866 --> 00:01:25,355

that after I die if I have been doing so much

japa, prayer, all these stuff, I will be free."

我已经如此念诵 祈祷了很多 所有的这些事 我死后 我将会自由



14

00:01:25,933 --> 00:01:28,511

And then you live your life

like a savage, you know,

接着你的生活过的像一个野人



15

00:01:29,022 --> 00:01:34,155

and thinking that yes, you will be free because

that priest has told you yes, you will do so much

并认为着是的 你将会自由因为神父已经告诉过你是的 你要念诵很多



16

00:01:34,888 --> 00:01:38,333

japa, then you do everything mechanically,

everything, then you say, yes, you will be free.

接着你机械地做着每一件事 接着你说 是的 你将会自由



17

00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,555

You will never be free!

你永远也不会自由



18

00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,822

Because freedom is

not attained just like that.

因为自由不是像那样去获得的



19

00:01:50,866 --> 00:01:55,622

That's why I said, you know,

the mind has to surrender.

那就是为什么我说 头脑必须臣服



20

00:01:57,488 --> 00:02:01,466

Otherwise, if that mind is not

surrendered, you can't attain Him.

否则 如果那个头脑不臣服 你不能臻达祂
